\maketitle

\section{Background}
%In about half a page, summarize your current state. For this Research Log, this is likely a summary of your prior interests. If you already know what you are interested in doing, you’d write about that; if you don’t, you’d write about your more general interests in Educational Technology.



\section{Papers}
%As you walk through the Research Guide, you’ll be finding lots of papers to read. Here, you’ll make a list of the papers you come across and give considerable attention to. We would expect the Research Log to include at least 15-20 sources (though more is fine as well), and at least 12 (preferably more) should be academic and peer-reviewed. You may include blog posts, newspaper articles, etc. as well, but you should have at least 12 academic sources, too. In the list, for each source, you’ll provide:
%The paper’s bibliographic information (its APA citation, typically)
%In around one sentence, how you found it (a Google Scholar search? From a conference’s proceedings? From another paper’s references? %Something else?)
%In around three sentences, a brief, original summary in your own words
%In around three sentences, the main takeaways going forward



\section{Synthesis}
%In about a page, summarize the overall body of work you’ve put together. What are the high-level trends, large takeaways, or open questions you’ve found? If you’ve narrowed in on a particular domain, summarize that domain; if you’re still exploring, discuss the overall direction these efforts are leading you toward. Most importantly, anchor this synthesis in the papers you provided above, citing them where appropriate.



\section{Reflection}
%In about half a page, reflect on the process of finding sources, reading papers, synthesizing their contents, and building your understand. What was difficult, and what was easy? What are you finding yourself interested in going forward?

    
\section{Planning}
%In about half a page, provide a plan for what you expect to do next week. What threads or ideas will you pursue? What questions will you seek answers to in the literature?
